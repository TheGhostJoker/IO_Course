# Implementation part of the Summer IO course

the code is divided into weeks, with jupyter notebooks in each of those directories.

Install anaconda and jupyter notebook. You should have scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and Tensorflow (if not Tensorflow, then PyTorch) installed.

Week 4 onward, there are implementations of neural networks in Tensorflow. However, I encourage you to look at Pytorch if you're interested as well. I will provide links to detailed explanation and implementation in Pytorch at the end of every TensorFlow implementation.

If you are stuck with anything related to neural networks at any point (not just the implementation but the concept itself), then read the PyTorch documentation on that topic. [This](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is the link to the docs. 
A simple google search of the format ```<concept_name> :pytorch``` in the search bar will get you the pytorch docs as the first result. I recommend it as they are very well written.
