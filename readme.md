# Implementation part of the Summer IO course

the code is divided into weeks, with jupyter notebooks in each of those directories.

Install anaconda and jupyter notebook. You should have scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and Tensorflow (if not Tensorflow, then PyTorch) installed.

Week 4 onward, there are implementations of neural networks in Tensorflow. However, I encourage you to look at Pytorch if you're interested as well. I will provide links to detailed explanation and implementation in Pytorch at the end of every TensorFlow implementation
